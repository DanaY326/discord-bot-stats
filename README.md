# Message Analyzer Discord Bot
This is a Discord Bot that will read your messages and return insights! What's the longest message in your server? Who texts the most on the server? What was said on your birthday last year? Find out the answer to all of these questions!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Discord.js

[Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.]

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

[You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!]

## Lessons Learned:

This is the first time I've made my own app from top to bottom. One thing I'm glad I got in the habit of was organizing everything in this repository into folders, as the amount of files just kept increasing! Testing was also super important, there were little bug fixes or tweaks that I'd make, and I thought there was *no way* they could affect anything, and  yet when I retested, I would have a new bug to find!
